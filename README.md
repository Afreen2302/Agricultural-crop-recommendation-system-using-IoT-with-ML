## Agricultural crop recommendation system using IoT with ML
Predicting crop outcomes remains among the most formidable challenges in the agricultural domain. 
Often, farmers or agriculturists select crops without due consideration of market dynamics or weather-related risks, resulting in crop losses and, in severe cases, bankruptcy. 
This project endeavors to forecast crop yields under specific weather conditions, consequently offering recommendations for the most suitable crops for a given field.
